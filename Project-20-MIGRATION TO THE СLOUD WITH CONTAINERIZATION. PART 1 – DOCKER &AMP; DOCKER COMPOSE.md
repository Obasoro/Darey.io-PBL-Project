## Developing MySQL in container

Let us start assembling our application from the Database layer â€“ we will use a pre-built MySQL database container, configure it, and make sure it is ready to receive requests from our PHP application

Make sure docker is installed on the system(locally or remote server)

`$ docker pull mysql/mysql-server:latest`
