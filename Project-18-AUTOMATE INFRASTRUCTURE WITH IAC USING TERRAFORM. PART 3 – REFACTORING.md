The above architecture is to carried out using terraform ans was done in Project-16 and 17 respectively. 
But in this project, we would be sung modules and s3 bucket as backend configuration.

Here is our plan to Re-initialize Terraform to use S3 backend:

- Add S3 and DynamoDB resource blocks before deleting the local state file
- Update terraform block to introduce backend and locking
- Re-initialize terraform
- Delete the local tfstate file and check the one in S3 bucket
- Add outputs
- terraform apply
