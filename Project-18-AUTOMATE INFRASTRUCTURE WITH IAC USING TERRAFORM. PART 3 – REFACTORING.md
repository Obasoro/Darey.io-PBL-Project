# AUTOMATE INFRASTRUCTURE WITH IAC USING TERRAFORM. PART 3 â€“ REFACTORING

## Introducing Backend on S3

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29310552/187100100-2470053b-6afa-462f-96b2-fa120da4e319.png)

The above architecture is to carried out using terraform ans was done in Project-16 and 17 respectively. 
But in this project, we would be sung modules and s3 bucket as backend configuration.

Here is our plan to Re-initialize Terraform to use S3 backend:

- Add S3 and DynamoDB resource blocks before deleting the local state file
- Update terraform block to introduce backend and locking
- Re-initialize terraform
- Delete the local tfstate file and check the one in S3 bucket
- Add outputs
- terraform apply


- 1. Create a file and name it backend.tf.

```
# Note: The bucket name may not work for you since buckets are unique globally in AWS, so you must give it a unique name.
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "terraform_state" {
  bucket = "dev-terraform-bucket"
  # Enable versioning so we can see the full revision history of our state files
  versioning {
    enabled = true
  }
  # Enable server-side encryption by default
  server_side_encryption_configuration {
    rule {
      apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
        sse_algorithm = "AES256"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- 2. Next, we will create a DynamoDB table to handle locks and perform consistency checks. In previous projects, locks were handled with a local file as shown in terraform.tfstate.lock.info. 

```
resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "terraform_locks" {
  name         = "terraform-locks"
  billing_mode = "PAY_PER_REQUEST"
  hash_key     = "LockID"
  attribute {
    name = "LockID"
    type = "S"
  }
}

```
Terraform expects that both S3 bucket and DynamoDB resources are already created before we configure the backend. So, let us run terraform apply to provision resources.

- 3. Configure S3 Backend
```
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "dev-terraform-bucket"
    key            = "global/s3/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "eu-central-1"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
    encrypt        = true
  }
}
```

- 4. Verify the changes

- 5. Add Terraform Output

Before you run terraform apply let us add an output so that the S3 bucket Amazon Resource Names ARN and DynamoDB table name can be displayed.

```
output "s3_bucket_arn" {
  value       = aws_s3_bucket.terraform_state.arn
  description = "The ARN of the S3 bucket"
}
output "dynamodb_table_name" {
  value       = aws_dynamodb_table.terraform_locks.name
  description = "The name of the DynamoDB table"
}
```

- 6. Let us run terraform apply

Security Groups refactoring with dynamic block

For repetitive blocks of code you can use dynamic blocks in Terraform.
