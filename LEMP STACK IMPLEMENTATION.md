# Step 1: INSTALLING THE NGINX WEB SERVER

 In order to display web pages to our site visitors, we are going to employ Nginx, a high-performance web  server. Weâ€™ll use the apt package manager to install this package.

 We would start by updating the created ubuntu instance on AWS using the following command line
 
 `$ sudo apt update`

 We would now install the nginx web server using this command
 
 `$ sudo apt install nginx`
  
 We would comfirm if the nginx server is now running and active by running this command
 
 `$ sudo systemctl status nginx`
