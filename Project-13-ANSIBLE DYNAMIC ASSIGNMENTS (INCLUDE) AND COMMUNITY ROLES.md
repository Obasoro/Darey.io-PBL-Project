# ANSIBLE DYNAMIC ASSIGNMENTS (INCLUDE) AND COMMUNITY ROLES

<strong>Ansible</strong>: Ansible is an actively developing software project, so you are encouraged to visit Ansible Documentation for the latest updates on modules and their usage.

Last 2 projects We gained some knowledge and skills on Ansible, so you can perform configurations using playbooks, roles and imports. Now you will continue configuring your UAT servers learning and practicing new Ansible concepts and modules.

In this project we will introduce dynamic assignments by using ***include module.

Now you may be wondering, what is the difference between static and dynamic assignments?

Well, from Project 12, you can already tell that static assignments use import Ansible module. The module that enables dynamic assignments is include.
